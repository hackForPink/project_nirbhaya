1,What is inflammatory breast cancer?,"Considered a rare disease, inflammatory breast cancer (IBC) typically forms in the soft tissues, blocking lymph vessels in the breast skin. That's why the breast often becomes firm, tender, itchy, red and warm, from the increase in blood flow and a build-up of white blood cells. IBC differs from other forms of breast cancer, especially in symptoms, prognosis and treatment. The term �inflammatory� is not meant to reflect what's happening inside the breast, only in how the breast appears. When an infection or injury causes the breasts to become inflamed, they often become tender, swollen, red and itchy, but the underlying cause is not inflammation."
2,When should I begin screening for breast cancer?,"The American Cancer Society (ACS) recommends the following early-detection screenings for women at average risk for breast cancer: Optional mammograms beginning at age 40. Annual mammograms for women ages 45 to 54. Mammograms every two years for women 55 and older, unless they choose to stick with yearly screenings MRIs and mammograms for some women at high risk of breast cancer. The ACS also recommends that women know the benefits and potential harms associated with breast cancer screening, as well as how their breasts normally look and feel and report any changes to their doctor right away."
3,What if I don't want cancer treatment?,"No treatment is without some sort of risk. A decision to decline treatment has its own risks, too. Breast cancer patients may refuse their doctors� treatment recommendations in whole or in part. Palliative care, designed to help control severe side effects such as pain, nausea or other symptoms, may help you manage your quality of life in the meantime."
4,Is my cancer invasive or noninvasive?,"A tumor is an abnormal growth that may be benign or malignant. Benign breast tumors are not life-threatening and do not spread to other parts of the body. Malignant breast tumors are cancers that impact your health and may spread to other parts of the body. A malignant tumor that grows into surrounding tissue is considered invasive. Invasive tumors are more likely to spread to other parts of the body than non-invasive tumors. Non-invasive breast cancer cells remain in a particular area of the breast without spreading to surrounding tissue, lobules or ducts."
5,What stage is my cancer and what does it mean?,"Staging is a way to describe the severity or extent of your cancer. Knowing the cancer stage will help your care team recommend a personalized treatment plan specific to your disease. Breast cancer diagnosed as stage I or stage II is considered early stage, while stages III and IV are considered advanced."
6,What size is my tumor and why does that matter?,"Treatment options for breast cancer partly depend on how small or large your tumor is, if the cancer has spread to the lymph nodes and if the cancer is found in other parts of your body. The larger the tumor, the more likely it is that the breast cancer is lymph node-positive, meaning the axillary lymph nodes contain cancer. Sentinel node biopsy is the most common way to determine whether cancer cells have spread beyond the breast."
7,How much experience do you have treating my type and stage of breast cancer?,"Oncologists who are experienced in not only treating breast cancer but in your specific type of breast cancer are typically better equipped to explain and deliver the full range of treatment options. You should feel comfortable asking your doctor about his or her experience. Doctors and the hospitals they may work for are not required by law to publish the survival rates of the patients they treat, but some choose to do so. Others may be willing to provide these statistics upon request."
8,Should I get a second opinion?,"A second opinion may confirm your original diagnosis and treatment plan, provide more details about the type and stage of your breast cancer, raise additional treatment options not considered, or lead to a recommendation for a different course of action. A second opinion may also help you feel more confident in your treatment decisions and help you find a doctor you feel comfortable with."
9,Has the cancer spread to my lymph nodes or other organs?,"Cancer may spread from the site where it originated to other parts of the body. When cancer cells move away from a tumor, they may travel through the bloodstream to distant organs. If they travel through the lymph system, the cancer cells may end up in lymph nodes. The lymph nodes in the underarm are the first-place breast cancer is most likely to spread. Your doctor may perform a biopsy to check for the presence of cancer cells. The sample is examined by a pathologist who checks the nodes under a microscope. That exam determines lymph node status. The spread of cancer to another part of the body is called metastasis. If breast cancer has metastasized to other areas of the body, it is categorized as stage IV breast cancer. Typically, breast cancer metastasizes primarily to the lungs, liver, brain, regional lymph nodesand bone."
10,Were HER2 tests performed on my tissue sample?,"HER2 (which stands for human epidermal growth factor receptor 2) is a type of growth signal receptor, or antenna that may be present on your breast cancer cells. About 25 percent of breast cancers are HER2-positive, meaning the cancer cells make too much of a protein called HER2/neu, which indicates that the cancer may be more aggressive. If your cancer is HER2-positive, this helps doctors better predict whether the cancer may respond to certain targeted therapies."
11,Should I consider participating in a clinical trial?,"Breast cancer treatment has improved tremendously over the years, thanks to advances made possible because of patients who have been willing to participate in studies exploring treatment options, drug protocols or other approaches before they can be granted federal approval. These clinical trials may offer participants new treatment options that may have otherwise been unavailable to them, especially after exhausting conventional treatments. If you qualify for such a trial, ask your doctor about any concerns or questions you may have about participating, so that you may determine if it�s a good fit for you."
12,Should I consider genetic testing?,"Genetic testing may help determine if your cancer resulted from an inherited gene mutation. Genetic counseling may help you understand the risks, benefits and limitations of genetic testing in certain situations. A genetic counselor, doctor or other health care professional trained in genetics may help you and your family understand your test results and other findings, such as a genetic risk factor for another disease like diabetes or heart conditions."
13,What is the difference between radiation and chemotherapy?,"Chemotherapy involves medications delivered by injections or taken in pill form. This type of treatment is circulated throughout the entire body and is generally prescribed by a medical oncologist. Radiation therapy, delivered by a radiation oncologist, uses radiotherapy beams focused on a very specific area of the body in order to deliver high doses of the treatment while reducing the risk of radiation exposure to healthy tissue."
14,How can I ease the side effects of radiation therapy?,"Your care team may offer various supportive care techniques to help ease the side effects associated with radiation therapy for breast cancer. Pain management and oncology rehabilitation may help with skin pain and soreness and lymphedema management. Naturopathic support, nutrition therapy, oncology rehabilitation and mind-body medicine may help relieve fatigue. "
15,What are the potential side effects of radiation therapy?,"Many people who undergo radiation therapy for breast cancer have some breast pain and skin irritation. The affected skin may eventually become red and swollen like a sunburn. These conditions typically begin within a few weeks of starting treatment and go away on their own within six months after treatment ends. For some patients, these symptoms may not occur until several months or years after treatment. Other common side effects include fatigue, especially in the later weeks of treatment and for some time afterward, and firmness or shrinkage of the breast. Women who have had radiation therapy to the lymph nodes in the underarm area may develop lymphedema, a condition in which fluid collects in the arm, causing it to swell."
16,How often will I receive radiation therapy?,"Typical courses of radiation treatment are administered five times a week for about six weeks, though the total duration depends on a number of factors including the patient�s general health and medical history and the risk of cancer recurrence."
17,What is the goal of radiation therapy?,"Radiation therapy for breast cancer is typically given after a lumpectomy and sometimes after a mastectomy to decrease the risk of local cancer recurrence. The treatments typically start several weeks after surgery so the area has time to heal. Radiation therapy may be used: As a primary treatment to destroy cancer cells, Before another treatment to shrink a tumor, After another treatment to stop the growth of any remaining cancer cells, In combination with other treatments to stop cancer cell growth, To relieve symptoms of advanced cancer"
18,What is radiation therapy?,"Radiation therapy uses targeted energy like X-rays to kill cancer cells. If a breast tumor is large or not easily removed by surgery, radiation therapy before surgery may be recommended to help shrink the tumor. When used for breast cancer treatment, radiation is delivered to the affected breast and, in some cases, to the lymph nodes under the arm or at the collarbone. Radiation therapy is delivered in two main ways:  External beam radiation: This standard type of radiation therapy directs high-energy beams from a machine outside the body to cancerous cells within the body. Intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT), intraoperative radiation therapy (IGRT), TomoTherapy� and stereotactic radiosurgery are all forms of radiation therapy."
19,"After my breast cancer surgery, will I need radiation or chemotherapy or both?","The stage of breast cancer helps determine which treatment regimen your oncologist will recommend. After breast-sparing surgery, radiation treatments may be used to help destroy remaining breast cancer cells. Radiation therapy is typically given after surgery to lower the chance of a cancer recurrence. Adjuvant breast cancer chemotherapy may be used after surgery to destroy remaining cancer cells not killed during surgery."
20,What is breast reconstruction?,"Breast reconstruction may help restore the look and feel of the breast after a mastectomy. Many women who have had a breast removed opt for breast reconstruction�in some limited cases, at the same time as the mastectomy, but more often after the mastectomy procedure. With immediate reconstruction, a surgeon performs the first stage to rebuild the breast during the same operation as the mastectomy. A method called skin-sparing mastectomy may be used to save enough breast skin to cover the reconstruction. Breasts may be rebuilt using saline implants or autologous tissue (the patient�s own tissue from elsewhere in the body). Most breast reconstructions performed today use implants. For some reconstructions, more than one surgery may be needed. Mastectomy with reconstruction done on the same day is an option for many women, but the best approach for an individual should be determined through a discussion of various options between the patient and her surgeon. The decision to have reconstruction is a personal one. Some women choose not to have reconstruction. Others believe it helps their appearance and recovery."
21,Will my breast(s) look or feel differently after surgery?,"After a lumpectomy, or breast-sparing surgery, your breast may look much like it did before the operation. But if the tumor was large, your breast may look different or smaller. You will likely develop a scar at the site of the lumpectomy. You may also likely develop numbness along the scar. If lymph nodes in the underarm area are removed during surgery, you may experience some numbness in your arm. As your body continues to adjust to the effects of surgery, you may develop phantom sensations or phantom pain in the breast that has been removed. Those pains are more likely to develop if you experienced breast pain before your mastectomy.  After reconstructive surgery, you will have a breast-like shape, but your breast will likely not look or feel like it did before your mastectomy. You will have scars where the surgeon attached skin to make the new breast-like shape. If you have tissue flap reconstruction, you will have scars around the new breast and the area where the surgeon removed the muscle, fat and skin transferred for the reconstruction.   Although surgery leaves scars, some may fade somewhat over time."
22,How long will I be in the hospital?,"If a lumpectomy is performed, patients typically leave the hospital the same day as the surgery. In the case of a mastectomy, patients are more likely to stay in the hospital overnight."
23,What are the potential side effects of breast cancer surgery?,"Surgical procedures for breast cancer may cause short-term pain or discomfort in the treated area. Also, the muscles of the arm may feel weak, and the skin in the breast area may feel tight. Surgery involving the lymph nodes may also cause swelling in the arm, a condition known as lymphedema."
24,Which surgical option do you recommend? Why?,"To determine which surgical approach may address your needs and treatment goals, your surgical oncologist may rely on information from the radiologist, who reads imaging tests; the pathologist, who interprets the biopsy results; the radiation oncologist, who works with the surgeon to plan radiation treatment either during or immediately after surgery; and the medical oncologist, to predict how preoperative drug treatment may help reduce the size of the tumor. Depending on the biology and genetics of the tumor, your care team may recommend chemotherapy before or after surgery."
25,What are the different options for surgery?,"Surgery is the most common treatment for breast cancer. Procedures may include: Mastectomy: This surgery removes one or both breasts, including the breast tissue, nipple, areola and skin. Lumpectomy: Also known as breast-conserving surgery, this operation removes only the cancerous breast tissue while leaving as much healthy tissue as possible. A lumpectomy is not an option for every breast cancer patient. Sentinel node biopsy: This is the removal of one or a few of the first draining lymph nodes (glands under the arm) to determine whether cancer cells have spread beyond the breast. Oncoplastic and breast reconstruction surgery: This reconstructive technique reshapes the breast and also may be used to prevent scarring and deformation of the breast."
26,What type of breast cancer do I have?,"The most common types of breast cancer are: Invasive lobular carcinoma: This disease, accounting for one in 10 breast cancers, begins in the lobules, or the glands of the breast that make milk. Invasive ductal carcinoma: This cancer, accounting for about eight in 10 breast cancers, begins in the breast�s milk ducts, the thin tubes that carry milk from the lobules to the nipple."
27,What is breast cancer?,"Breast cancer is a common term for a cancerous (malignant) tumor that starts in the cells that line the ducts and/or lobes of the breast. Breast cancer is not one disease; rather it is several diseases that behave differently. Breast cancer�s causes are not exactly clear. Studies have identified numerous risk factors for breast cancer in women, including hormonal, lifestyle and environmental factors that may increase the risk of the disease. Other factors include: Increasing age, Personal history of breast cancer, Early menstruation, Late menopause, A first pregnancy after age 30 or no prior pregnancies, Use of oral contraceptives, Family history of breast cancer, Presence of certain inherited genetic changes, History of radiation therapy to the chest, Long-term use of combined hormone therapy, Alcohol use, Obesity after menopause, It's unclear why some people who have no risk factors develop cancer, while others with risk factors never do. "
28,What type of doctor should I see if I think I have breast cancer?,"If you think you have breast cancer, you should talk to your primary care physician or OB/GYN. A number of doctors may play a role in your breast cancer treatment. The following is a list of doctors who may be involved in your care: Medical oncologist: A physician who has special training in diagnosing and treating cancer using chemotherapy, hormonal therapy and targeted therapy, Surgical oncologist: A doctor who uses surgery to diagnose, stage and treat cancer and manage certain cancer-related symptoms, and who may perform biopsies and other surgical procedures such as removing a lump or a breast, Radiation oncologist: A physician trained in cancer treatment using radiation to shrink tumors and destroy cancer cells"
29,What treatment options are typically available?,"Breast cancer treatments have two main goals: to destroy as much of the cancer as possible, and to prevent tumors from returning. Some treatments remove or destroy the disease within the breast and nearby tissues, such as lymph nodes. These treatments include: Surgery: Surgical options include a mastectomy, which removes the whole breast, and a lumpectomy, or breast-conserving surgery that removes only the tumor and the tissues around it. Sentinel node biopsy is a surgical diagnostic technique that removes one or a few of the first draining lymph nodes (glands under the arm) to determine whether cancer cells have spread beyond the breast. Women who have surgery as part of their breast cancer treatment may choose oncoplastic and breast reconstruction surgery to rebuild the shape and look of the breast. Radiation therapy: This conventional technique uses targeted, high-energy radioactive waves to destroy tumors. Because these treatments often affect the lymph nodes, lymphedema is a common treatment-related side  effect for breast cancer patients who receive surgery or radiation therapy. Lymphedema is the buildup of lymphatic fluid under the skin, which often leads to swelling. The goal of other treatments is to destroy or control cancer cells all over the body. These include: Chemotherapy, which delivers anti-cancer drugs throughout the body to kill cancer cells, Hormone therapy, which uses drugs to prevent hormones from fueling the growth of breast cancer cells, Targeted therapy, which prompts the body's immune system to destroy cancer, Your doctor may recommend chemotherapy, hormone therapy or targeted therapy treatment along with surgery or radiation in order to kill cancer cells that were left behind by other treatments."
30,What are the possible side effects of each treatment option?,"Breast cancer treatments may cause temporary side effects that go away soon after treatment is completed, as well as longer-term side effects that last months or years. Below is a list of the side effects associated with each treatment option. Surgery: Surgical procedures for breast cancer may cause short-term pain or discomfort in the treated area. Also, the muscles of the arm may feel weak, and the skin in the breast area may feel tight. Surgery involving the lymph nodes may also cause swelling in the arm, a condition known as lymphedema. Radiation therapy: Many breast cancer patients who undergo radiation therapy experience skin irritation and breast pain. These conditions usually begin within a few weeks of starting treatment and go away on their own within six months after treatment ends. For some patients, however, these symptoms may not develop until several months or years after treatment. Another common radiation-related side effect is fatigue, especially in the later weeks of treatment and for some time afterward. Chemotherapy: Certain chemotherapy drugs may cause potential side effects like nausea, vomiting, fatigue, nerve damage, sore mouth, diarrhea, constipation and decreased blood counts. Hormone therapy: Some hormone therapies for breast cancer may cause a wide range of side effects, such as hot flashes; vaginal discharge, dryness and irritation; irregular periods; decreased sex drive; and mood changes. Aromatase inhibitors may also cause joint and muscle pain, as well as an increased risk of bone thinning (osteoporosis).  Targeted therapy: Side effects for HER2-positive targeted therapy drugs are typically mild, but serious side effects are possible and may include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, fatigue, mouth sores and rashes. "
31,How can I manage treatment-related side effects?,"The side effects of breast cancer treatment may be managed with evidence-informed therapies. The idea is to help you maintain your strength and stamina, so you are better able to stay on your treatment regimens without interruption. Naturopathic support, nutrition therapy, pain management and oncology rehabilitation are some examples of supportive therapies that may help breast cancer patients reduce the impact of cancer treatment side effects."
32,How quickly do I need to make a decision about breast cancer treatment?,"Treatment for breast cancer generally should start soon after diagnosis, but in most cases, it won�t hurt to wait a few weeks to begin treatment. Even more important than beginning treatment immediately is to understand and evaluate all your treatment options with your care team and loved ones, and then decide what�s best for you."
33,Will my breast cancer treatment affect my ability to have a baby?,"Women of childbearing age who are being treated for breast cancer may be concerned about the impact on their ability to conceive a child in the future. Treatments such as chemotherapy, radiation therapy or a combination of the two may affect fertility. Chemotherapy may affect the functioning of the ovaries, reducing the number or quality of eggs. These anti-cancer drugs may also cause infertility in women who haven�t started menopause (pre-menopausal). The likelihood of infertility may depend on the type of chemotherapy drugs used, the dose given and your age. Radiation therapy kills cancer cells by stopping or reducing their growth and division. Because radiation sometimes passes through healthy tissues, organs near the cancer site may be affected, potentially causing temporary or permanent infertility, especially if the radiation was delivered directly to the pelvic region. You may want to consider your options for preserving fertility before starting treatment and discuss your questions and concerns with your oncologist."
34,Can physical activity reduce the risk of breast cancer?,"Exercise boosts the immune system and helps you to keep your weight in check. With as little as three hours of exercise per week, or about 30 minutes a day, a woman can begin to lower her risk of breast cancer. This doesn�t require going to a gym either. Power walking is more than sufficient!"
35,Can a healthy diet help to prevent breast cancer?,"A nutritious, low-fat diet (30 grams or less) with plenty of fruits and green and orange vegetables can help reduce the risk of developing breast cancer. A high-fat diet increases the risk because fat triggers estrogen production that can fuel tumor growth."
36,Does smoking cause breast cancer?,"Smoking is a confirmed risk factor for many types of cancer. Recent research in the last year (2012) has confirmed that smoking is a contributing risk factor for developing breast cancer. Additionally, second hand smoke is also a risk factor for cancer. So if you are a smoker, help yourself in a significant way and join a smoking cessation program to help you stop. The day you stop smoking the healing can begin and each week in which you are smoke-free, you give yourself increasing advantages for a healthier life. Smoking also directly contributes to heart and other lung diseases, too."
37,Can drinking alcohol increase the risk of breast cancer?,"Moderation is key. One drink per day has been shown to slightly increase the risk of breast cancer. Having more than one drink per day has shown to be a more significant risk factor, and the alcohol content doesn�t matter: wine, beer or a mixed drink. Alcohol also increases estrogen in your bloodstream. Although we know that more than one drink per day increases risks, to date there are no studies that demonstrate directly that the more a person drinks, the greater their risk for cancer. And in some cases, drinking one glass of wine a day can offer heart-health benefit. If you drink alcohol, this is an important topic to discuss with your doctor so that you will know what limits are best for you to observe."
38,Is there a link between oral contraceptives and breast cancer?,"There is an increased risk of breast cancer for women who have been using birth control pills for more than five years. However due to the low amount of hormones in birth control pills today, the risk is relatively small. But if a young woman has a significant family history of breast cancer, her gynecologist may recommend taking a break for a year from the pill at the 5-year time frame then resuming again for another 5 years. Although evidence-based research data does not offer strong support for this standard of care, it has nevertheless become an increasingly common practice."
39,Is there a link between hormone replacement therapy (HRT) and breast cancer?,"Yes, there is. HRT was added to the carcinogenic list by the American Cancer Society in the early 2000s. It is recommended that women with known risks not be placed on HRT to control of menopausal symptoms. They should instead seek other safer alternatives."
40,How often should I do a breast self exam (BSE)?,"Give yourself a breast self-exam once a month. Look for any changes in breast tissue, such as changes in size, feeling a palpable lump, dimpling or puckering of the breast, inversion of the nipple, redness or scaliness of the breast skin, redness or scaliness of the nipple/areola area, or discharge of secretions from the nipple. If you discover a persistent lump in your breast or any changes, it is very important that you see a physician immediately. Though 8 out of 10 lumps are benign, all require evaluation to confirm that they are not cancerous. Women should perform their breast self exam 7-10 days after their menstrual period starts which is also when their breasts are the least tender and lumpy. If they are no longer menstruating, then she should select the same day of the month (first of the month for example) and mark it on the calendar to remind herself when to perform this self exam. What to look for is a change from last month�s exam to this month�s exam. It is not unusual to have lumpy or bumpy breasts. All women should know the geography of their own breasts. If having trouble remembering, draw a diagram of where the lumps, bumps, grooves, and other findings are felt so that this can be used as a reminder from month to month. There is no added value in doing breast self exams more often than monthly. Also the findings may be different as well, in relationship to where a woman is in her menstrual cycle."
41,Does a family history of breast cancer put someone at a higher risk?,"Although women who have a family history of breast cancer are in a higher risk group, most women who have breast cancer have no family history. Statistically only 5-10% of individuals diagnosed with breast cancer have a family history of this disease."
42,Are mammograms painful?,Mammography does compress the breasts and can sometimes cause slight discomfort for a very brief period of time. Patients who are sensitive should schedule their mammograms a week after their menstrual cycle so that the breasts are less tender. Your doctor may say it is fine to take acetaminophen an hour before the x-ray is performed to prevent discomfort too.
43,How does menstrual and reproductive history affect breast cancer risks?,"Women who began their menstrual cycles before age 12, have no biological children, or had their first child at 30 or older, or began menopause after 55 are at a higher risk. This means that research has proven that the number of menstrual cycles a woman has over time influences risk."
44,How often should I go to my doctor for a check-up?,"You should have a physical every year which should include a clinical breast exam and pelvic exam. If any unusual symptoms or changes in your breasts occur before your scheduled visit, do not hesitate to see the doctor immediately."
45,What kind of impact does stress have on breast cancer?,"In 2012, some research studies have shown that factors such as traumatic events and losses can alter immune system functions, and when immune functions are altered cancer cells may have an opportunity to get themselves established within one�s body. What has been shown is that it is not the fact that a major life crisis has occurred but instead how the individual reacted to this event and coped (or didn�t cope). Therefore, identifying ways to keep your stress level in check is wise."
46,What celebrities have or have had breast cancer?,"One in eight women will develop breast cancer at some point in her life. This statistic affects all women equally. You may have a one in eight chance of developing breast cancer, but so does your doctor�and your hairdresser�and the big-name actress in your favorite movie. Rich or poor, famous or unknown, the disease treats everyone the same."
47,Can breastfeeding reduce the risk of breast cancer?,Breastfeeding can reduce the risk of developing breast cancer.
48,Can I have a reconstruction at the same time as my mastectomy?,"All women who have a mastectomy should be offered reconstruction and in many cases the two procedures can be done at the same time. Your team should discuss the options with you - in some cases you may be advised to have the reconstruction at a later date. Reconstruction can be a complex procedure with a longer recovery and can delay further treatment, so in some cases it may be advisable to leave it until treatment is complete."
49,I'm really worried about having chemo - will I lose my hair and be sick?,"These days there are medicines that are effective in controlling sickness in most patients. Always let your nurse or doctor know if you feel, or are sick after chemotherapy, so that they can prescribe another anti-sickness medication that works better for you. Some types of chemotherapy cause hair loss or thinning, and many women do lose their hair. Wearing a cold cap during treatment lowers the temperature of your scalp which reduces blood flow and, therefore, the amount of chemotherapy reaching your hair follicles. Thanks to the amazing fund raising efforts of breast cancer charity Walk the Walk, our media partner for the last three years, 340 scalp coolers are now available for patients in 127 hospitals throughout the UK."
50,I'm in my thirties and need chemotherapy - will it trigger the menopause?,Chemotherapy can trigger the menopause and the likelihood increases as you get older. Some women experience a temporary menopause - their periods stop but then come back. Some chemotherapy combinations are less likely to affect fertility and these days cancer teams do everything they can to help women retain their fertility and will often have fertility experts on hand to offer advice. There is ongoing research to find the most effective ways to help women maintain their chances of having a child.
